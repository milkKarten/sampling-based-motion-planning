# A repository containing a nearest neighbor data structure based on a graph.

## COMPILING
To build the package, follow these steps in the package directory:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
This will create a bin directory in the package directory where an executable
main is created. 

## EXECUTING
To run the executable,
```
cd ../bin
./main
```

After this first run with cmake, you can just run

```
make
```
in the build directory when you make code changes.
